    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" style="margin-bottom:5px">Landing page</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The current Civil Service job and career proposition is divided between a <a href="https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi" target="_blank">job search site</a> and a <a href="https://www.civil-service-careers.gov.uk/" target="_blank">career site</a>. Both are independently maintained and have different styles: the job search site follows GDS patterns, while the careers site is Wordpress-based and follows a non-GDS design.</p><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our aim was to investigate the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is two separate sites necessary, or could one site cover careers and a job search?</li>
        <li>would a new site have to be designed outside of GDS constraints (i.e. more 'corporate', more freedom to use imagery, video etc) or would a GDS version be sufficient to engage users?</li>
        <li>what do users need to know / want to see on this site?</li>
        <li>would users be happy to link out to existing content (for example on the existing careers site) or would the jump be too distracting for them?</li>
        <li>is the job search the most important aspect and so have to be prominent on the page?</li>
        <li>what mediums (e.g. video, PDF, podcast) would be useful to a user?</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We designed two basic landing pages to show to users:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="https://csj-candidate-experience.herokuapp.com/landing-page" target="_blank">a GDS-friendly version</a> (version A), only slightly off GDS standard: large image, uses of video etc</li>
        <li><a href="https://csj-candidate-experience.herokuapp.com/landing-page-non-gds" target="_blank">an off-standards version</a> (version B), with more imagery, sliding job search and non-standard sections / content display</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Version B was designed with the most relevant content on it (at least as far as we could guess, based on previous evidence / desktop research). Version A had some matching content, but was mainly to be used as a simple comparison with B: if A had the same content as B, but displayed in a 'less appealing' way, would it be enough to engage users used to corporate-level job and career sites?</p><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>User research</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://app.mural.co/t/civilservicerecruitment8943/m/civilservicerecruitment8943/1680693151065/a3f1783f2f4fd90158b95bae6f81a4d0ba00dca0?sender=u21f36a9fedce292b06138582" target="_blank">Mural board with testing notes</a></p><br>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we found</strong></p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>videos were not well received, both because of the uninspiring static image and because few users we actually interested in watching them</li>
        <li>it was difficult to get a definitive list of what users would want to see on a candidate landing page, as each user was in their own position (e.g. looking for career info, wanting to search for a CS job, wondering about transferring across CS etc) and thus had their own needs. However, the 'What we offer' and 'How to join' sections were well received generally</li>
        <li>a 'career finder' tool was considered useful</li>
        <li>showing some edge case info - like prison leavers, veterans - led to questions about what info we weren't showing. Users felt it was better to cover everyone or not at all, for example by using FAQs to cover all situations</li>
        <li>all users asked would be happy to answer some short questions that would lead to content targeted to them e.g. don't show info that the user has said is not relevant to them</li>
        <li>no user struggled with the idea of clicking links which took them to the career site, and some users commented on how they liked the layout of the career site</li>
        <li>most users preferred version B, but it was felt that this was as much to do with the better content than it was the difference in design from version A</li>
        <li>some users found version B led to a lot of scrolling, especially due to the large main image</li>
        <li>most users did not want to read lengthy PDFs or listen to podcasts. However, they did want to see a summary of the info they contained and have the option to go to the PDF or podcast if they wanted to at another time</li>
        <li>the idea of a single site - covering job search and career info - had a mixed response: some users thought it was a sensible idea, others felt there was no need to muddy the waters if you only wanted to do one or the other</li>
        <li>the job search was considered very important, and although some users were happy with version B's hidden search feature, most felt it would be best on the page near the top</li>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" style="margin-bottom:5px" id="portal">Candidate portal</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The current <a href="https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi" target="_blank">Civil Service jobs site</a> has a limited candidate portal, with features restricted to viewing current and previous applications, and setting up job alerts.</p><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our aim was to investigate the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>what features would a candidate want in their portal?</li>
        <li>how would candidates react to a portal designed along the lines of the existing Career Site (i.e. non-standard font, non-GDS designs)?</li>
        <li>would being proactively contacted about possible jobs be beneficial?</li>
        <li>would advice in the form of messages (e.g. 'You can set up alerts for jobs like Delivery Manager') be helpful?</li>
        <li>is a job search needed on this page, or just a link to one?</li>
        <li>how keen are candidates to be able to reuse info they've already given?</li>
        <li>does giving them sections to complete at the appopriate time (e.g. completed an application, so we ask if they want to set up a job alert for this, or see other jobs with same title) help candidates?</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We designed a sign-in page (linked from a dummy Career Site page with a 'Sign in' button added), which linked to one fo the two following variations:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="https://csj-candidate-experience.herokuapp.com/dashboard-cs-style" target="_blank">a basic portal as would be seen if a candidate just signed up</li>
        <li><a href="https://csj-candidate-experience.herokuapp.com/dashboard-cs-style-later" target="_blank">a more populated portal based on a candidate who has made some applications, saved some jobs, filled in their personal details etc</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>User research</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://app.mural.co/t/civilservicerecruitment8943/m/civilservicerecruitment8943/1683623960575/18666886601916e4ad986df8a2abac093988f24c?sender=u21f36a9fedce292b06138582" target="_blank">Mural board with testing notes</a></p><br>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we found</strong></p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>users generally liked the Career Site-style design, although one user thought it looked too much like the Guardian website(!)</li>
        <li>sign up on the sign in page caused some confusion, as users didn't read the inset text</li>
        <li>Google and LinkedIn were not popular sign-in options, as many users felt they were insecure, not allowed at work or too personal to use</li>
        <li>some users expected to go straight to a 'search for jobs' page after signing in</li>
        <li>messages did not test well: some users didn't want messages at all, others didn't notice their purpose (to give advice at pertinent times)</li>
        <li>users were unsure whether they wanted / needed to see their login details so prominently on the page</li>
        <li>joining a talent pool was seen as a good (and new) option</li>
        <li>some users favoured having a search bar on their portal, although others were happy with the existing link (if renamed to 'Search for job' instead of 'Apply for job')</li>
        <li>all users wanted to reuse previously submitted info in some way</li>
        <li>The personal details section had too much prominence / was placed too high on the page</li>
        <li>the application panel would be even more useful if it explained what was current, status of each application and showed draft applications</li>
